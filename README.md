# Excel-macros
Macros created to run without needing a base template - These VBA macros were created using a combination of recorded steps and online resources.

| **[Comprehensive Address Report](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/ComprehensiveAddressReport.vba)**    | 08/2022 |This macro consolidates a manually extracted daily report into a merged quarterly report for analyst review. It was developed to streamline processing, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistent formatting. The macro has since been refined into a standalone template, which will be uploaded shortly. |
| **[FWA Split](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/FWA%20Split.vba)**            | | The Flexible Work Arrangement (FWA) report is extracted daily, formatted, and saved for integration with other reports. This macro was developed to ensure consistent formatting, preserve tab names, and minimize manual processing time. |
| **[Garnishment Wire Form](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/GarnWireForm.vba)** | | The original macro, which has now been commented out, was developed for a task I previously managed. This responsibility has since been delegated to other analysts, and a new template has been created (upload pending). The prior process involved importing Excel report data into a template that formatted, filtered, and pivoted the data on a separate tab. This, in turn, automatically populated a third tab where the macro generated a PDF and initiated an email to our payroll partners. |
